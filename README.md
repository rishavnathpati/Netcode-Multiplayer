## Features

- Sync game objects across the network in real-time.
- Flexible and efficient serialization for optimized network performance.
- Support for authoritative server-client architecture.
- Customizable synchronization rules for specific components or properties.
- Lag compensation for smooth gameplay experience.
- Reliable and unreliable messaging channels for different types of data.

## Installation

To use the Netcode for Game Objects library in your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the contents of the `Assets/Netcode` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` folder.
3. Ensure that you have Unity 2021.1 or later installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Open the `SampleScene` scene located in `Assets/Scenes`.
2. Press the play button to run the scene in the Unity Editor.
3. Start another instance of the Unity Editor and press the play button again to run a second instance of the scene.
4. Interact with the game objects in either instance, and you will see the changes synced across the network.

Feel free to explore the code in the `Assets/Scripts` folder to understand how the synchronization is implemented.
